Hi I'm George Holden, a final semester Computer Science Student and Tutor from the University of Canterbury. I currently live in my hometown of Christchurch New Zealand but am moving to Wellington after graduating mid-year. 

## Introduction to Programming
While I've been around computers my whole life, my first introduction to Computer Programming didn't come until I dove straight into the deep end and started studying Computer Science in 2018. I fell in love with Python immediately, and have been writing it ever since. 

It's only fitting that given the opportunity, I would try to give that experience to others and at the start of 2021 I got that chance. I've been tutoring professionally for the University of Canterbury ever since, teaching beginner level Python to students just like me. Educating others is one of the most satisfying parts of my Computer Science journey. I've also tutored a range of 100-200 level courses privately.
